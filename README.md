# Reddit Clone App on MERN Stack
A toy application replicating Reddit's functionalities using the MERN stack.

I've decided to created this to help improve my programming/web dev skills. 
Prior to this application I only had exposure to HTML/CSS, Java, PHP (CakePHP for a backend framework) and MySQL from university.

I've decided to take on this stack to help improve my programming in general (front and back end) and to also: Learn a NoSQL DB, learn JavaScript from scratch (ES6), learn a popular front end framework,
understand package management, simple implementation to a dev environment, improve on css and ui/component frameworks, etc.

CURRENTLY WORKING ON:

* Set up API routes for USERS, POSTS and INTERACTIONS and their collections
* Develop a rough front end design layout/container and stylesheet
* Implement authorisation (email/password) / User can log in / User can log out
* Allow users to create a post
* Allow users to delete a post
* Allow users to vote on a post

SOME FUTURE GOALS IN MIND:
* Allow users to make comments on posts, with add/edit/delete functionalities
* Posts (and by extention comments) can be sorted by NEW/TOP/BEST
* User can view their profile, with comment history, point tracking, website stylesheet settings
